# Predicting-Stock-Prices-with-Linear-Regression

In this project, I'll be predicting Stock Prices with a linear regression model. I'll begin by deriving some additional features from the dataset on which to train the model. I'll then evaluate which features were the most impactful and alter the model accordingly. 

Unsurprisingly, the best predictor of the price on a given day was the previous days price. This highlights one of the limitations of linear regression models, as various features were used to predict price but were related to it in a non-linear way, and were therefore unhelpful in the models.
